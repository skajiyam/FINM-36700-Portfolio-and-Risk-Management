1. Barnstable's Philosophy:
Q: 
(1) What has Barnstable’s investment strategy been in the past?
(2) Explain the logic behind their view that stocks are safer in the long run.
(3) What assumptions underlie Barnstable’s belief in the long-run safety of stocks?

A:
(1) Be fully invested in equities at all times
(2) In the past, the endowment was manageed under the belief that stocks would outperform safer asset classes such as Bonds or Treasury bills. The logic is that short-run demands on the endowment were relatively sdmall, there seemed no point in sacrificiing long-run returns by holding other assets that offered greater near-term safety.
(3) Stock market movements are random, the day-to-day or month-to-month risks are sequentially uncorrelated


2. Two Proposals: 
Q: Describe the two proposals Barnstable is considering for how to take advantage of their view regarding the long-run safety of stocks.

A:
(1) Selling long horizon put options on the S&P 500
(2) Creating a trust that would own the stocks in the S&P 500 on the asset side and would have two classes of shares (Preference Shares & Common Shares) on the liability side

3. The Trust:
Q: How is the trust different from simply shorting the risk-free rate to take a levered position in stocks?

A: In the trust, leverage is inside the trust itself, whereas simply shorting the risk-free rate creates leverage outside the portfolio.
(they produce the same exposure but differ in terms of who bears the risk & financing)

4. Payoff Differences:
Q: Do these proposals take the same bet on long-run stock performance? In what outcomes will they have different returns?

A:
- Common shareholders only earn a positive payoff if stock market's value > compounded risk-free growth
- Put seller earns profit if the market > strike

5. Risk Differences
Q:  Do the two proposals differ in their risk?

A: Yes (mathematically the trust behaves linearly whereas the puts behave nonlinearly)

6. Recommendation
Q: Do you recommend a direct investment in the S&P, the trust or the puts?

A: direct investment in the S&P
- The other options seem to have more risk: levered linear risk and greater volatility in the trust and nonlinear risk with potential for massive losses in the puts
- Direct investment has a linear exposure with no leverage, and no amplified gains/losses
