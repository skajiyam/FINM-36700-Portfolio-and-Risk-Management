Answers for READ Section of HW2:

1. Alternative ETFs: Describe the two types of investments referenced by this term.

The first type is Alternative Asset classes, which include investment types that provide exposure to real or tangible assets. These include real estate, commodities and preciouss metals, currencies, and private equity. The second type is Alternative strategies, which tend to use more unconventional approaches like maintaining multiple x leverage, short selling a particular position, and absolute return. These alternative strategies can be less correlated to traditional strategies by design.

Answer: 

2. Hedge Funds: 
a. Using just the information in the case, what are two measures by which hedge funds are an attractive investment?

Hedge funds, as the name suggests, tend to provide absolute returns regardless of the market condition (bearish or bullish). This became popular in the 1970s bear market. Additionally, due to their low correlation of returns with other equities, hedge funds provide an excellent way of diversifying the portfolio and reducing risk.
Using information just from the case, according to slide 8, hedge funds delivered 10% higher reutrns than stocks and over twice that of bonds. Furthermore, HFRI showed an attractive sharpe ratio from 1994 to 2013 and displayed less than half the volatility of the S&P 500.

b. What are the main benefits of investing in hedge funds via an ETF instead of directly?

It's more convenient to invest via an ETF, since hedge funds often only allow accredited investors with a certain net worth to invest. Furthermore, you're able to invest in multiple hedge funds via an ETF, which allows diversification compared to having exposure to only one hedge fund.

Answer: 

3. Benchmarks:

a. Explain as simply as possible how HFRI, MLFM, MLFM-ES, and HDG differ in their construction and purpose.
The Hedge Fund Research index reflects the collective performance of over 2000 hedge funds that are only available to accredited investors. By tracking this performance, it aims to diversify and introduce the returns of these hedge funds to a wider audience.

The Merrill Lynch Factor Model aims to replicate hedge fund returns using six factors (S&P 500, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE, MSCI EM, USD/EUR FX, 3-mo Eurodollar), updated monthly and with exposure constraints at each rebalance.

The MLFM-ES (Exchange Series) allows the factor model to be tradeable. This serves its purpose as an index to be followed so that the Hedge Replication ETF (HDG) can track it.

The HDG is the ETF product that consists of various long and short positions on equities, T-bills, etc.. and seeks high correlation to Hedge Funds by tracking the HFRI index.

b. How well does the Merrill Lynch Factor Model (MLFM) track the HFRI?
The correlation as of December 2013 is 0.900.

c. In which factor does the MLFM have the largest loading? (See a slide in Exhibit 1.)
The factor in which MLFM has the largest loading is U.S. Treasury bills.

d. What are the main concerns you have for how the MLFM attempts to replicate the HFRI?
- Should the MLFM even attempt to replicate the HFRI if the index is projecting low hedge fund performance? Yes, that is its purpose but there's a point that offering a product with lower returns compared to the S&P 500 makes it less marketable.

- The MLFM is based on various market factors such as S&P 500, USD/EUR FX, etc... do these really allow for the same returns of a hedge fund manager that embraces illiquidity. How do these market factors provide that illiquidity?

- Dynamic regression used to construct the weight of six factors was a backwards-looking exercise that lagged behind since it didn't know about changes in hedge fund styles. This methodology could be concerning.

Answer: 

4. The HDG Product:
a. What does ProShares ETF, HDG, attempt to track? Is the tracking error small?
b. HDG is, by construction, delivering beta for investors. Isn’t the point of hedge funds to generate alpha? Then why would HDG be valuable?
c. The fees of a typical hedge-fund are 2% on total assets plus 20% of excess returns if positive. HDG’s expense ratio is roughly 1% on total assets. What would their respective net Sharpe Ratios be, assuming both have a gross excess returns of 10% and volatility of 20%?
